Subject: [PATCH] usb: dwc3: meson-g12a: do post init to fix broken usb after
 resumption

Device connected to usb otg port of GXL-based boards can not be
recognised after resumption, doesn't recover even if disconnect and
reconnect the device. dmesg shows it disconnects during resumption.

[   41.492911] usb 1-2: USB disconnect, device number 3
[   41.499346] usb 1-2: unregistering device
[   41.511939] usb 1-2: unregistering interface 1-2:1.0

Calling usb_post_init() will fix this issue, and it's tested and
verified on libretech's aml-s905x-cc board.
